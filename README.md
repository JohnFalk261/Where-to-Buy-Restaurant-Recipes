# Wondering Where to Buy 300+ Restaurant Recipes? 📗

You've come to the right place!

You’re probably reading this post because you’re wondering where to buy restaurant recipes. Luckily for you I think I’ve found the best place — and I’m going to do my best at writing a bit about it below. It’s called RecipeSecrets.

Sales have been slowing at national restaurant chains like Red Lobster, TGI Fridays, and the Cheesecake Factory recently due to the increase in gas prices.

To make matters worse, more and more people are discovering that they can save money by making their favorite restaurant dishes at home following the step by step instructions of Master Chef Ron Douglas.

The so called “secret recipes” of these billion dollar restaurants have now been revealed and shared with the world in the cooking instructional guide “America’s Restaurant Recipes.” For details, go to:

Douglas is facing major pressure to take down his site and discontinue all sales of his secret recipe cookbooks. But he continues to thumb his nose at the greedy restaurant executives in support of the budget constrained home cook.

Anyone looking to duplicate their favorite restaurant recipes should pick up “America’s Restaurant Recipes” now before it’s forced off the market. Go to:
